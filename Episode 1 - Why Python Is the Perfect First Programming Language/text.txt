“Why Python Is the Perfect First Programming Language”
Description:
Python is the easiest programming language to start with — but most beginners learn it the wrong way. In this video, I explain why Python is the perfect first programming language and show real code examples inside VS Code.
You’ll understand what Python actually is, why it’s used everywhere, and see your first working program — with zero experience required.
This is Episode 1 of The Python Path — a complete step-by-step Python learning series for absolute beginners.

SCREEN: VS Code already open in full screen, dark theme, empty file named intro.py.
YOU SAY:
Welcome to The Python Path — and today, I’ll show you why Python is one of the most beginner-friendly programming languages ever created.
Mini pause. Calm confidence.
YOU SAY:
Not with complicated theory — but with real code, right here inside VS Code.
YOU SAY (as you begin typing):
Let me show you something extremely simple.
SCREEN: Type:
print("Hello, world!")
YOU SAY (naturally as you finish typing):
Just one line of code.
SCREEN: Run the file — terminal shows: Hello, world!
YOU SAY:
That’s a complete Python program. One line — and it already works.
This simplicity is one of the biggest reasons why Python is the perfect first programming language.
SCREEN: Scroll slightly for space and type under it:
name = "Maria"
print("Hello, " + name)
YOU SAY:
For example — this is enough to make the computer greet someone by name.
SCREEN: Run again — output: Hello, Maria
YOU SAY:
No confusing symbols. No setup pain. It almost reads like English.
SCREEN: Add a quick comment block below:
# Python is used for:
# - Web apps
# - Data & AI
# - Automation
YOU SAY:
And Python isn’t just beginner-friendly.
It powers websites like Instagram.
It runs machine learning and AI.
And even automates boring everyday tasks — like cleaning files or sending emails automatically.
YOU SAY (slightly more inspiring tone):
So whether you dream about building websites… AI tools…
or just automating your own life — learning Python can take you there.
SCREEN: Clear screen or open new file basics.py.
YOU SAY:
And here’s how we’re going to learn Python on this channel.
I won’t jump straight into complex theory.
And I also won’t just throw code at you without context.
We’ll do this the right way — step by step, with real understanding and real practice.
By the end of every lesson, you won’t just watch Python — you’ll actually write Python yourself.
YOU SAY:
No experience needed. I’ll explain everything clearly — but without wasting your time.
SCREEN: In basics.py, type:
# What is Python?
# You write instructions.
# Python reads them.
# The computer executes them.
YOU SAY:
Python is just a language — a way to give instructions to a computer.
You write instructions. Python reads them.
And your computer executes them — step by step.
SCREEN: Type a simple analogy:
# Example:
# Imagine telling a robot:
# "Go forward 3 steps"
# "Turn left"
# "Pick up the box"
YOU SAY:
Imagine you’re giving instructions to a robot. Step by step.
That’s literally what programming is.
Programming is just giving clear instructions to a computer.
YOU SAY (transition):
So now — let’s check if Python is already installed on your system.
SCREEN: Open VS Code terminal, type:
python --version
YOU SAY:
If you see a version number here — perfect.
If not — no problem.
In the next video, I’ll show you exactly how to install both Python and VS Code properly, step by step.
So don’t worry if yours doesn’t show anything yet — you’re still following correctly.
YOU SAY (inspiring closing tone):
If this is your first step into programming — you’ve already done more than most people ever do.
You now understand what Python really is — and in the next video, we’ll install everything together and start writing real code.
You’re officially on the path.
This is just the beginning.
